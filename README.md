Your privacy in the world is almost gone. Everyone is collecting as much information as they can about you, to use it for their own needs or to use it against you in order to make you spend more money, or to expose you to propaganda and to brainwash you. These days, you almost cannot consume information without being exposed to certain companies, that try to seduce you, in order to increase their profits by using sophisticated marketing manipulations.

Your private information is worth money, and it's not about your email or passwords. It's about your internet behavior, and telling you the right thing at the right time in order to maximize profits, or by showing you a fake view designed specifically to change your mind regarding certain issues.

This is where Traffico can help. By monitoring behind the scenes for every website you visit and by setting simple filters, you can protect yourself against known companies who try to collect information about you.
